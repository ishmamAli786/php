<?php
//difference between interface and abstract class



//an abstract class can have only abstract methods or only non-abstract methods or both,but all method of an interface are abstract by default
//an abstract class can declare propeerties/methods with access spcifier, but interface can declare only constant properties(no other type properties) and methods are by default abstract and public
// a class can inherit only one abstract class and multiple inheritance is not possible for abstract class but A class can implement more than one  interface and can achieve multiple inheritance
//if a class contains even a singal abstract method that class must be declared as abstract
// in an abstract class, you can defined as well as it's body methods but in the interface you can define only methods
